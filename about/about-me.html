			<p><em>* This is a live document and some of the questions / answers may be updated to reflect my changing opinions. Facts will stay unchanged. *</em></p> <h1>Tell me something about yourself</h1> <h2>Short Answer:</h2> <p>I am really into sci-fi movies and have watched all of the good ones available there have been (80s onwards). Also, these days I am totally loving reading articles, papers and theories about machine learning, especially the transfer learning, ontology, unsupervised learning and Bayesian as well as active inference. But I am really shaky with the maths. Oh, and you can ask talk to me for hours about privacy, smart-phones, free software, photography and importance of narratives.</p> <h2>The boring answer <em>(may be the one you wanted ?)</em>:</h2> <ul> <li>Software engineer turned product management professional with total of 10 years experience</li> <li>Initial 4 years working at Infosys for Investment Banking clients; Next 3 years with IGT (working for SITA) and ADP</li> <li>Past couple of years as founding partner of own venture, working on NLP based custom solutions for qualitative research</li> <li>Strongly opinionated on some topics and biased for data-supported claims / decisions</li> <li><strong>Keywords</strong>: <em>Roadmap, User Stories, Prioritization, Ideation, Customer Engagement, Scrum, Agile, JIRA, Rally, Mock ups, Balsamiq, Python, Machine Learning, SQL, Shell</em></li> </ul> <h1>What are you doing these days? Anything cool?</h1> <p>Glad you asked! </p> <ul> <li><p>I am <strong>currently working on couple of NLP projects.</strong> One of the projects is for improving document clustering in n-dimensional space based on configurable parameters. </p> <p>In simple words, I am trying to come up with <em>a system to group documents / text in clusters and rank each one in the corresponding cluster based on given criteria (say, grouped by reading-difficulty level and sorted by document size)</em> </p> <p>Ultimately though, I want to be able to come up with robust systems to </p> <ul> <li>Semantically simplification of complex documents (e.g, user agreements to bulleted point summary)</li> <li>Extraction of well defined (SMART) goals from a natural language job requirement (which may lead to an even larger project for later) </li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>But remember Maths being my weakness when it comes to hard core ML ? <br> Well, it turns out I am not particularly strong at programming either after being away from day-to-day hands-on coding for past 6 years. </p> <p>I can still read and understand the code and do some exploratory analysis in Python and hack together some scripts in Shell or may be even JS, but that's about it. </p> <ul> <li><p>So, <strong>another thing I am doing is hacking away at publicly available datasets using Python</strong> and in the process <strong>exploring SciKit, Pandas, Numpy, MatPlotLib and interesting GitHub projects</strong> related to NLP. </p> <p>Employment related data sets and govt datasets on education are my favorites. Also, I just discovered FastText by Facebook last week (Early November 2018) or so.</p></li> <li><p>Finally, I am also <strong>looking for fun teams to work with who are working on interesting problems related to these areas</strong>. <br> Or solve something cool while still being able to remain in touch with these areas ("these areas" being data-exploration and analysis, machine learning models, and other stuff mentioned in the Short Answer about myself). </p></li> </ul> <h1>That's interesting! What about some of your previous work - anything I would know or might have seen / used?</h1> <ul> <li><p>Well, my early experience (pre-2010) was with large Investment Banks (with names sounding like Oldman Wax, etc) where I worked on systems flagging anomalous financial transactions. <br> So, I hope you would not have come across this bit of my previous work.</p></li> <li><p>Post 2010, my work was largely around border security systems. The visa processing, passenger manifest systems and the likes. <br> You might have had knowingly or unknowingly an experience with some bit of my work in this phase if you have traveled to Middle East, few countries in South East Asia or Australia. <br> But not something you would have noticed; it was all behind the scenes. <br> In the off-chance you did come face to face with the "back-end" system, I am really sorry for the inconvenience.</p></li> <li><p>Most recently, in 2015-16, I got to deliver a pretty slick looking Reporting system for HCM (Human Capital Management) folks. <br> If you are on the payrolls of a USA company, there is about 17% chance that your HR person would have had experience with this shiny new tool. </p> <p>But do remember: HR people use a plethora of products from different vendors even for related tasks (vendor-diversification and all that). So, if you hear some hate from them for the systems they use, it probably is not ours. Ours was awarded one of the best design refreshes in the industry.</p></li> <li><p>Last couple of years (2017-18) was spent primarily working on some nifty, custom solutions for name de-duping, auto-labeling and categorization of survey-responses, etc. If you have participated in or conducted some such surveys over the past couple of years, there is a non-zero chance of your responses having being processed by our systems. Please note that all such solutions provided were completely owned and operated by our clients and we have no access to any bit of the data processed. </p></li> </ul> <h1>We are big fans of Agile. Do you have any experience working in an agile environment?</h1> <p><code>TBD</code></p> <h1>More to come soon...</h1>
