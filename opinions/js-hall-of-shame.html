			<p><em>_TO DO_</em> <em>1. Check term accuracy: defensive programming, etc</em> <em>2. Link to standard definitions</em> <em>3. Edit the prose</em></p> <p><code>&lt;rant&gt;</code> <br> I had just filled up the form halfway when the "Country/State" drop-downs came up. Only trouble, there were no options to select. "No worries" - I thought, the field does not seem to be mandatory anyway (no asterisk mark or other equivalent visual indication).</p> <p>Trudging through the remaining fields of the form - leaving another few of the optional ones blank - I completed the form and click "Submit". And nothing happens.</p> <p>Of course, I click it a couple more times understanding full well the stupidity of my repetitive clicks. May be just in frustration. Another case of <em>ungraceful failure</em>. I check the Firefox console and sure enough, seems like some JS failure on submission. </p> <p>I go on and enable some of the JS on the page and get some of the drop-down fields to start accepting text values. But of course, couple of minutes later it's the same story - "Location has to be selected from the list of options". So, then I go on enable a few more scripts on the page so that the fields can make AJAX calls to populate the said options and allow me to choose from them.</p> <p>And so it goes on for a good 15 minutes. A frustrating, draining and all too common situation these days. The page was a recruitment funnel for one of the clients of GreenHouse.Io - a recruitment services provider who apparently provide an "amazing applicant experience". <code>&lt;/rant&gt;</code> </p> <p>I started out thinking this is over-reliance on JavaScript. But the longer I think about it, the more strongly I believe it's not JS reliance which is the problem. It's the lazy programming. <strong><em>The implicit assumption that every single soul on the internet is allowing any random JS to run willy-nilly on the device she is using.</em></strong></p> <p>Armed with this erroneous assumption, the developers don't even think about defensive programming or graceful failure patterns with respect to JS dependence. Just how difficult it is to do a on-load check to see if the browser has JS support enabled? Of course, a good service/product will work around this limitation (think Gmail). But at the very least, a developer can warn the end users about JS requirement and declare that certain parts of the page may not work correctly without JS.</p> <p>I have compiled below a list of websites with such lazy programming. <br> This is going to be a running list which I will keep updating based on my time / interest - as and when I encounter more of such pages:</p> <pre><code>1. Greenhouse.io 2. Icicibank.com - especially their dashboard page 3. Google re-captcha implementation </code></pre>
