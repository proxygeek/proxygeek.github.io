			<p>From HackerNews front page on 2018-11-01:</p> <p>a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18347841">post</a> citing an <a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-little-known-reason-pencils-yellow">article from Artsy about why "Pencils are yellow"</a> is on the front page today.</p> <p>A classic example where a conclusion was drawn from limited data and an explanation was provided for the said conclusion without citing or checking the applicability of either.</p> <p><strong>Erroneous conclusion</strong>: <em>Pencils are yellow. At least generally.</em></p> <p>``` As pointed out in numerous replies to the post (and personal experience), people from different regions have different notions about default colors of pencils.</p> <p>For me, it has always been red and black stripes, thanks to <a href="https://cwpencils.com/collections/nataraj/products/621-hb-pencil">Natraj Co.</a> ```</p> <p>Surprisingly, the red-black color combo is not even unique to India. Users from New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, UK, Switzerland and other regions also reported same default colors.</p> <p>Of course, a variety of other color schemes from different regions around the world were reported.</p> <p><strong>An explanation was provided for the phenomenon</strong></p> <p>I do not have any issues with the explanation provided - I liked the story but have not checked its veracity though. But the overly-broad and hence erroneous conclusion it is trying to support reduces its credibility.</p> <p><strong>Applicability of the proclaimed hypothesis was not specified.</strong></p> <p>The only concession about the generality of the claim was the below cursory remark by the author:</p> <p><code> Of course, not all pencils today are painted yellow. Many are the color of a company logo or a university sports team or, in the case of the mechanical pencil, not painted at all. But the pencil as we conceive of it, the pencil of a Google image search or an elementary school memory, is—because of the marketing genius of 19th-century pencil manufacturers—yellow. </code></p> <p>And even in here are the assumptions that the elementary school memory is valid for all the readers. Or that the Google image search results are uniform for all users.</p> <p><strong>Why does it matter</strong></p> <p>It matters because this encourages shoddy reasoning.</p> <p>Unless we are careful in generalizing, it might not be a very long journey from "why pencils are yellow" to "why women are whiny" to "why Jews are stingy" or "why Muslims are violent".</p> <p>You do not need this article to tell you that of course some the above generalizations do exist - with explanations more colorful than those for yellow pencils, no less.</p> <p>We call such generalizations as stereotypes. And stereotypes are almost never good. I hope we can agree on that.</p> <p><strong>About stereotypes</strong></p> <p>I think stereotypes are not ever going away anywhere because they serve as a handy approach to reduce the computational overload of our brains.</p> <p>Think of them as analogues of brands - only murkier.</p> <p>Organizations spend billions of dollars in branding so that they can craft an identity in the consumers' minds that when they think of a brand, they associate certain attributes to it.</p> <p>Stereotyping is similar but something we do to ourselves. But that's another topic for another day.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>At the end of the day, we are all guilty of making such broad generalizations at one point or other.</p> <p>The only thing we can do is to recognize and correct such mistakes before these morph into stereotypes held by us and start clouding our thinking.</p>
