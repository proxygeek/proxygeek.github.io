			<p>Woke up early today and faced the truth — my calendar is a meeting marathon. Seven hours. Starting at 10 AM. Last one ending at 8 PM. Quite a few back-to-back. And can we talk about the irony of having meetings to discuss having fewer meetings?</p> <p>Here’s the part where I confess: most meetings, I'm just a fly on the wall. And I'm starting to question the why.</p> <p>Take these update meetings we schedule. Are they checkpoints or just security blankets? Let’s be honest, a deadline does the job without the extra meeting time.</p> <p>Visibility meetings? Here’s where you get to "shine." Or is it just a polite way of saying "show up or else"? Skipping out paints you as the office maverick. Dare to miss, and you’re not playing ball. It’s the silent pressure to conform.</p> <p>And don't get me started on retrospectives. An hour and a half of what exactly? We talk, but do things change? We could just as easily weigh in asynchronously. Make decisions. Take action. No meeting required.</p> <p>Now, I’ll give a nod to my engineering team meetings — these feel necessary, a space for crucial stakeholder decisions. Even so, does everybody need to be there? Maybe it's time to trust smaller groups to call some shots. We're all adults here, after all.</p> <p>Org-wide meetings dressed up as workshops are a genre of their own. It’s less about making decisions, more consumption of broadcast material. If it’s the learning we’re after, let’s lean into on-demand courses. Save everyone time. Make it count.</p> <p>Here's my pitch: let’s challenge the meeting-heavy culture. Prioritize autonomy, embrace asynchronous communication, and let’s reserve our shared time for moments that truly benefit from collaboration.</p> <p>Because you know what we don’t need? Another meeting about meetings. Let’s get to work.</p>
