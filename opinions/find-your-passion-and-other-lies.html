			<p>We often hear the advice to "find your passion" and follow it. But is it really that simple? Is passion a fixed trait that we are born with, or is it something that can be developed over time? And what happens when we encounter obstacles and setbacks on the path to pursuing our passions?</p> <h3>Passions and Interests are not fixed and not limited</h3> <p><em>Fixed theory vs. Developing theory</em> It's important to understand that passions and interests are not fixed. The idea that we have one true calling or purpose in life is a myth. Our interests and passions can change and evolve over time, and that's okay. In fact, having a growth mindset and being open to new experiences can lead us to discover new passions that we never knew we had.</p> <h3>Passion does not always equal motivation</h3> <p><em>Motivation is a finite resource</em> Following your true passion does not mean that there will always be an endless supply of motivation on the road to your goal(s). Motivation is indeed a finite resource. Be sure you start with a large reserve. The reality is that pursuing any goal requires hard work, perseverance, and sometimes even sacrifice. It's important to have realistic expectations and to be prepared to face challenges along the way.</p> <ul> <li><em><strong>Corollary</strong>: Lack of motivation at some stage should not be grounds for deciding that you are on the wrong path. And I am not talking about continued disinterest.</em></li> </ul> <h3>Failure does not always equal lack of skill</h3> <p>Failure does not mean that we are not cut out for something. It simply means that we were not ready at that particular moment to achieve our goals. </p> <p>It might be a bad day; Much better competition; poor fit or something entirely different.</p> <p>We can learn from our failures and use them as opportunities to grow and improve. And sometimes, it's just a matter of timing and being patient until the right opportunity comes along. </p> <h3>Documented Difference</h3> <p>Finally, it's important to have a clear plan and strategy for achieving our goals. Even more important, we should be able to articulate what changes are you making in your strategy. It could be as simple as "more of X". But without any changes at all, it's just depending on blind luck; not a recipe for success. </p> <p><em>Finding your passion is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It's a journey of self-discovery that requires patience, perseverance, and a willingness to learn and grow. By having a growth mindset and being open to new experiences, we can discover new passions and achieve our goals, even in the face of obstacles and setbacks.</em></p>
